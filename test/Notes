sinon.stub() and sinon.spy() are functions provided by Sinon.js.
sinon.stub():
Purpose: The primary purpose of stub is to replace a function or method with a Sinon stub.
Stubs are like spies, but they also have the ability to override the behavior of the 
original function or method.

Behavior: When you create a stub using sinon.stub(), you can define how the stub should 
behave when called, specify return values, and even replace the implementation of the 
original function. This makes it useful for controlling the behavior of dependencies 
during testing.



sinon.spy():
Purpose: The primary purpose of spy is to observe a function or method, tracking 
information about its calls (such as the number of times it was called, arguments, etc.), 
without affecting its behavior.

Behavior: When you create a spy using sinon.spy(), the original function or method is not 
replaced or modified. Instead, the spy wraps around the original function and allows you to 
observe its behavior.
